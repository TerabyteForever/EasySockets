# SpaceSockets
## Makes socket programming much easier for C++ developers.

It supports both TCP and UDP methods, but TCP method has some problems. So, I'll probably fix that later.

```sh
 $ sh make.sh // GNU/Linux, FreeBSD etc.
```
```sh
 $ fscrift make // For Scrift.
```

[21.07.2020 20.14] One of the major bugs has been solved. You can send your messages without any limitation now!

## Warning: It doesn't work on Windows. It only works at GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, UNIX-like and UNIX-based operating systems.
